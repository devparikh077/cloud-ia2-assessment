# Node.js Application Dockerfile

This repository contains a Dockerfile to build a Docker image for a Node.js application.

## Dockerfile Explained

Here's a breakdown of each instruction in the Dockerfile:

* **FROM node:14:**
    - This line sets the base image for our build process. We're using the official `node:14` image, which provides a pre-configured environment with Node.js version 14 installed.
* **WORKDIR /usr/src/app:**
    - This sets the working directory inside the container to `/usr/src/app`. All subsequent commands will be executed within this directory.
* **COPY package*.json ./:**
    - This copies both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if it exists) from your local directory to the working directory in the container.
    - This is done before installing dependencies to leverage Docker's layer caching and make subsequent builds faster if these files haven't changed.
* **RUN npm install:**
    - This command uses the Node Package Manager (npm) to install all project dependencies as listed in the `package.json` file.
* **COPY . .:**
    - Once dependencies are installed, this command copies the entire application code from your local directory to the working directory (`/usr/src/app`) inside the container.
* **EXPOSE 8080:**
    - This informs Docker that the container listens on port 8080 at runtime. You'll need to map this port to a port on your host machine when running the container to access the application.
* **CMD ["node", "server.js"]:**
    - This sets the default command to run when the container starts. In this case, it starts the Node.js application by executing `node server.js`. Make sure to replace `server.js` with the actual filename of your main application file if it's different.

## Building and Running the Image

1. **Build the Docker image:**
    - Open a terminal in the directory containing the Dockerfile.
    - Run the command: `docker build -t your-image-name .`
    - Replace `your-image-name` with the desired name for your image.

2. **Run the Docker image:**
    - `docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name`
    - This command runs the image and maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

## Additional Notes

- You can customize the exposed port and the startup command as needed for your application.
- Consider using multi-stage builds for more complex applications to optimize image size.
- Remember to update the README with specific instructions or information relevant to your application.
